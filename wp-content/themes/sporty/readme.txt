sporty is a responsive, highly customizable theme.


Customizing theme
-------------------------------------------
Theme options are in the Appearance > Customize Tab in Admin. Here you can select from 4 different color layout options. You can also add your own logo, header, background, social media links and feature text area (for homepage just below slider).


Homepage Layout
-------------------------------------------
Homepage layout can be set by making a page and selecting "Custom Home Page" from the Template options.
 - The top featured post (below slider) will appear when that post is set as sticky. 
 - Recent Posts. The latest 3 posts are picked up and displayed under the recent posts section. A featured image will have to be added for the thumbnail to appear.
 - Homepage slider instructions are below.


Adding images to homepage slider
-------------------------------------------
A post category called "Featured" and with the slug "featured" will have to be added to your post categories. The slider will pick up the latest 3 posts from this category and the image if you have set a featured image. Image size should be at least 960px width and 300px height.
