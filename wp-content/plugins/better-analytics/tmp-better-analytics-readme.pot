If you utilize the default Google Analytics API project credentials, the system will ask you for permission to access your data.  Google will then issue a one-time use code that is exchanged for OAuth2 credentials that are used when making Google Analytics API calls.  <strong>The code is one-time use</strong> (meaning if someone intercepted it and redeemed it for credentials, you wouldn't be able to yourself).  After your site redeems the code, it's no longer valid.  The resulting credentials are stored inside your installation and are never sent anywhere.  That being said, if you are still worried about the security of your Google Analytics data, you are able to utilize your own Google Analytics API project credentials (it's just a little more work for you to set up that Google API project - the only API type that you need to enable under that project is the Google Analytics API)."

If any Google Analytics plugin authors are interested in somehow consolidating plugins, let us know (not really sure how that would work to be honest, but something we could brainstorm and figure out the best way to do it that works for everyone)."

This means if your site uses CloudFlare, the JavaScript code used by Google Analytics will be cached in their data centers and delivered to end users via the closest data center (long story short is that it will make for a faster user experience)."
